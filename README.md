# docroo-google-cloud-sdk-sphinx
The official repo is stored on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/alteroo/docroo-google-cloud-sdk-sphinx

Docker image with sphinx, sphinx_rtd_theme and google-cloud-sdk
Used in a Gitlab Pipeline for Deploying private Sphinx based documentation to Google App Engine
Based on the Docroo project

Old habits die hard so this relies on buildout (I'm sure I could use pip to install)
